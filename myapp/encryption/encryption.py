# This file should be located in the encryption folder. Below, I've used Python's built-in cryptography library to implement a basic encryption and decryption function. It uses Fernet symmetric encryption, which means the same key is used to both encrypt and decrypt data.

# Please note, it is important to keep the key secret. Anyone with access to the key can decrypt your data.
